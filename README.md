# Security Reviews Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of independent security
reviews, analyses, and audit-style reports conducted across different
technologies and environments. The primary purpose of this repository is
to document security findings in a transparent, structured, and
reproducible manner, while also demonstrating methodology, reasoning,
and professional judgment applied during security assessments.

The materials stored here are intended for educational, research, and
professional reference purposes. They are not meant to replace full
formal audits unless explicitly stated in a specific report.

## Scope

The repository may include, but is not limited to:

-   Smart contract security reviews (e.g., Ethereum, EVM-compatible
    chains, Vyper/Solidity)
-   Code-level vulnerability analysis
-   High-level architectural security evaluations

Each review typically focuses on a defined scope and threat model, which
is clearly stated in the corresponding report.

## Methodology

While methodologies may vary depending on the target system, most
reviews follow a combination of:

-   Manual code review
-   Static analysis
-   Logical and architectural reasoning
-   Adversarial thinking and threat modeling
-   Best-practice comparison against industry standards

It is worth noting that different security professionals may reasonably
disagree on severity classification, risk prioritization, or recommended
mitigations. Where applicable, alternative interpretations or trade-offs
are acknowledged.

## Severity and Risk

Severity labels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational) are
inherently contextual. They depend on assumptions such as deployment
environment, attacker capabilities, and asset value. Readers are
encouraged to interpret findings within the stated threat model rather
than treating severity ratings as absolute.

## Limitations

-   Reviews are point-in-time assessments and may become outdated.
-   Findings are based on the provided scope and available information.
-   Absence of a reported issue does not imply absence of risk.

Security is an evolving process rather than a final state.

## Responsible Use

The information in this repository should be used responsibly. While the
intent is to improve security and understanding, misuse of disclosed
techniques or vulnerabilities is strongly discouraged.
